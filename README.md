## About Me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tyler, a software engineer in his mid-30s with passions in application development, retro video game development, and retrocomputing in general. I don't have much of a public portfolio or social media presence, but that will not stop me from learning, building, and collaborating!

## Projects

* [ðŸ€„ Mahjong Tile Solitaire](https://github.com/teaplz/2ctilesol): A web adaptation of a particular variant of the game of mahjong solitaire, built with React and Vite and deployed on GitHub Pages.
