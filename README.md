## About Me

Hey there! 👋 I'm Tyler, a software engineer in his mid-30s with passions in application development, retro video game development, and retrocomputing in general. I don't have much of a public portfolio or social media presence, but that will not stop me from learning, building, and collaborating!

You can find my website [here](https://teaplz.github.io)!
